# Details
Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.
# Tasks
Using the Random Forest algorithm on UCI banknote authentication Data Set to classify the notes into Authentic or Fake. The project is mainly divided into following subsections.
1. Model development in python
2. Creating pickle file of python code
3. Creation of simple web app by using Flask and flasgger
4. Containerazition of the model by using Docker Containers
